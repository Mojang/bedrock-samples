<h1><p id="Overview">Overview</p></h1>

Features are decorations scattered throughout the world. Things such as trees, plants, flowers, springs, ore, and coral are all features. Basically, if it isn't the terrain or a mob, it's probably a feature!</br>Features can be standalone or composed of multiple sub-features. In practice, most features in Minecraft are defined as a chain of two or more features. These chains typically end with features that place blocks in the world. Other feature types control flow such as conditional, sequential, or random distribution.</br><a href="#Index">Back to top</a><br><br>

<h1><p id="JSON format">JSON format</p></h1>

All features must specify the version that they target via the "format_version" field. The remainder of the data is contained in independet JSON sub-objects for each supported feature type. These feature types define the behavior of the feature and include properties specific to that behavior. To be valid, a definition must include exactly one of these type objects. See the full feature schema below for additional details and the full list of supported feature types.</br><h2></h2>
Here is a sample feature<br / ><textarea readonly="true" cols="49" rows="16">

<h1><p id="Adding features">Adding features</p></h1>

Features are read from JSON files in the "features" subfolder of behavior packs. Loading enforces one feature per file; the file name and the name of the feature must match. Feature names can include a namespace of the form "namespace:feature_name" to help distinguish them from features that may be in other behavior packs. This namespace is not considered when matching the filename to the feature name. For example, in a file called "my_tree_feature.json" both "my_tree_feature" and "my_pack_name:my_tree_feature" would be valid identifiers. If two behavior packs define the same feature name (including namespace), then the feature from the highest pack in the stack will be used. This allows users to override base features if desired.</br><a href="#Index">Back to top</a><br><br>

The next feature in the sequence begins at (0, 10, 0).</br>Succeeds if: All features in the sequence are successfully placed.</br>Fails if: Any feature in the sequence fails to be placed.

Each layer is searched from the bottom-left to the top-right before moving to the next layer along the axis. By default, only one valid position must be found, but this can be altered by specifying the 'required_successes' field.

<h1><p id="minecraft:single_block_feature">minecraft:single_block_feature</p></h1>

'minecraft:single_block_feature' places a single block in the world. The 'places_block' field supports a single block or a list of weighted blocks, where the weight defines how likely it is for that block to be selected. The 'may_attach_to' and 'may_replace' fields are allowlists which specify where the block can be placed. If these fields are omitted, the block can be placed anywhere. The 'may_not_attach_to' field is a denylist that specifies what blocks can't be close to the placement location. The 'randomize_rotation' field will randomize the block's cardinal orientation. The block's internal survivability and placement rules can optionally be enforced with the 'enforce_survivability_rules' and 'enforce_placement_rules' fields. These rules are specified per-block and are typically designed to produce high quality gameplay or natural behavior. However, enabling this enforcement may make it harder to debug placement failures.</br>Succeeds if: The block is successfully placed in the world.</br>Fails if: The block fails to be placed.</br><h2></h2>
Example use: Placing a single pumpkin or carved pumpkin block where carved pumpkins are less likely to appear.<br / ><textarea readonly="true" cols="53" rows="32">

'minecraft:structure_template_feature' places a structure in the world. The structure must be stored as a .mcstructure file in the "structures" subdirectory of a behavior pack.

Features must be attached to at least one biome in order to show up in the world. During world generation, biomes attempt to place their attached features chunk-by-chunk. Features can be attached via a feature rule definition</br><a href="#Index">Back to top</a><br><br>

<h1><p id="Feature rules">Feature rules</p></h1>

Feature rules are separate JSON definition files found in the "feature_rules" subfolder of behavior packs. Feature rules follow the same filename rules as features. Each feature rule controls exactly one feature and serves as the root of a chain of feature data. To attach a feature to a biome with a feature rule, the "conditions" object must include the "minecraft:biome_filter" field. This is a list of filter tests that are performed on each biome to determine if the feature should be attached. Most relevant is the "has_biome_tag" test.</br><h2></h2>
