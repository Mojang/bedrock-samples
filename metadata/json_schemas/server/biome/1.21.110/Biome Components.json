These tags are listed here:\nbirch: Biome uses wildflowers (mutually exclusive with other flower biome tags). Does nothing if biome is tagged \"hills\".\ncold: Villagers will be dressed for snowy weather.\ndeep: Pre-Caves and Cliffs, prevents an ocean from having islands or connected rivers and makes the biome less likely to have hills.\ndesert: Allows partially-buried ruined portals to be placed in the biome. Sand blocks will play ambient sounds when the player is nearby.\nextreme_hills: Ruined portals can be placed higher than normal. Biomes tagged \"forest\" or \"forest_generation\" will use normal Overworld flowers instead of forest flowers.\nflower_forest: Biome uses forest flowers (mutually exclusive with other flower biome tags).\nforest: Biome uses forest flowers (mutually exclusive with other flower biome tags). Does nothing if biome is tagged tagged \"taiga\" or \"extreme_hills\".\nforest_generation: Equivalent to \"forest\".\nfrozen: Villagers will be dressed for snowy weather. Prevents the biome from containing lava springs if it is also tagged \"ocean\".\nice: Around ruined portals, lava is always replaced by Netherrack and Netherrack cannot be replaced by magma.\nice_plains: Prevents the biome from containing lava springs if it is also tagged \"mutated\".\njungle: Ruined portals will be very mossy.\nhills: Biomes tagged \"meadow\" or \"birch\" will use normal Overworld flowers instead of wildflowers.\nmeadow: Biome uses wildflowers (mutually exclusive with other flower biome tags). Does nothing if biome is tagged \"hills\".\nmesa: Sand blocks will play ambient sounds when the player is nearby.\nmountain: Ruined portals can be placed higher than normal.\nmutated: Pre-Caves and Cliffs, prevents switching to the specified \"mutate_transformation\" as the biome is already considered mutated. Prevents the biome from containing lava springs if it is also tagged \"ice_plains\".\nno_legacy_worldgen: Prevents biome from using legacy world generation behavior unless the biome is being placed in the Overworld.\nocean: Prevents the biome from containing lava springs if it is also tagged \"frozen\". Allows ruined portals to be found underwater. Pre-Caves and Cliffs, determines if shorelines and rivers should be placed at the edges of the biome and identifies the biome as a shallow ocean for placing islands, unless the \"deep\" tag is present.\npale_garden: Biome uses closed-eye blossoms (mutually exclusive with other flower biome tags).\nplains: Biome uses plains flowers (mutually exclusive with other flower biome tags).\nrare: Pre-Caves and Cliffs, this tag flags the biome as a special biome. Oceans cannot be special.\nswamp: Allows ruined portals to be found underwater. Biome uses swamp flowers (mutually exclusive with other flower biome tags).\ntaiga: Biomes tagged \"forest\" or \"forest_generation\" will use normal Overworld flowers instead of forest flowers.\n"
