Sand blocks will play ambient sounds when the player is nearby.\nextreme_hills: Ruined portals can be placed higher than normal.

Pre-Caves and Cliffs, determines if shorelines and rivers should be placed at the edges of the biome and identifies the biome as a shallow ocean for placing islands, unless the \"deep\" tag is present.\npale_garden: Biome uses closed-eye blossoms (mutually exclusive with other flower biome tags).\nplains: Biome uses plains flowers (mutually exclusive with other flower biome tags).\nrare: Pre-Caves and Cliffs, this tag flags the biome as a special biome.
