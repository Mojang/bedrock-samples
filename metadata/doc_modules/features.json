        "Features are decorations scattered throughout the world. Things such as trees, plants, flowers, springs, ore, and coral are all features. Basically, if it isn't the terrain or a mob, it's probably a feature!",
        "Features can be standalone or composed of multiple sub-features. In practice, most features in Minecraft are defined as a chain of two or more features. These chains typically end with features that place blocks in the world. Other feature types control flow such as conditional, sequential, or random distribution."

        "Features are read from JSON files in the \"features\" subfolder of behavior packs. Loading enforces one feature per file; the file name and the name of the feature must match. Feature names can include a namespace of the form \"namespace:feature_name\" to help distinguish them from features that may be in other behavior packs. This namespace is not considered when matching the filename to the feature name. For example, in a file called \"my_tree_feature.json\" both \"my_tree_feature\" and \"my_pack_name:my_tree_feature\" would be valid identifiers. If two behavior packs define the same feature name (including namespace), then the feature from the highest pack in the stack will be used. This allows users to override base features if desired."

The 'may_not_attach_to' field is a denylist that specifies what blocks can't be close to the placement location. The 'randomize_rotation' field will randomize the block's cardinal orientation. The block's internal survivability and placement rules can optionally be enforced with the 'enforce_survivability_rules' and 'enforce_placement_rules' fields.
